# SeeSea
A project that aims to **see** how much environmental information can be recovered from images of bodys of water (**seas**). For example: wind speed, wind direction, wave height, wave direction etc.

The current plan is to create a training dataset of labeled images by collecting NOAA bouycam images, and labeling them with the environmental observation data from the time the image was taken. Building the dataset is an on going process as bouycam images are only available through the NOAA api for ~3 days after the images were captured.
